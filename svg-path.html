        <!-- the path element is meant for creating complex shapes, and uses commands & coordinates to determine how the shapes are drawn -->
        <!-- path is regarded as the most powerful shape because it can be conformed to draw any shape i.e. circles, rectanges, hexagons, or any shape -->
        <!-- paths can create shapes with straight or curved edges, and can have unlimited number of sides -->
        <!-- paths can be used to draw any of the shapes from shapes.html -->
