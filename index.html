            <!-- the browser will only draw the element if it is inside the svg tag -->

            <!-- stroke can be applied to any of the svg shapes, it gives a border with the color designated in stroke="" -->
            <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#F44336" stroke="#8BC34A"></rect>

        <svg width="500" height="500">
            <!-- if a border is added, a width must be specificed -->

        </svg>
        <!-- the value of these attributes can be any valid CSS color: named colors, hex values, rgba, & hsv -->
        <!-- fill, stroke, and stroke-width attributes are specific to svg elements only -->
        <!-- FYI: background-color does not work with svg elements, svg elements have separate properties, cannot use standard css properties to manipulate them  -->
        <!-- to change the color, need to set the "fill" property. certain CSS properties can only be applied to svg elements and vice versa -->
        <!-- current propblem with the stroke: it is larger on the bottom and right than left and top. this is happening because of overflow -->
        <!-- by default browsers hide shapes outside the bounds of the svg element -->
        <!-- strokes are generated by applying half the width inside and half the width outside. for each side, there are 5 pixels that are inside the element and 5 that are outside the element -->
        <!-- thanks to the overflow property the rectangle gets cut off as is currently coded -->
        <!-- the fastest solution is to set the overflow property to visible -->
        <!-- another solution: svg uses a coordinate system to position shapes -->
        <!-- by default all shapes have their x, y set to 0 (top left corner of the svg element) -->
        <!-- not restricted to the bounds of the svg elements. allowed to use negative numbers or numbers that exceed the width & height of the image  -->

        </svg>
        <!-- the coordinate system applies to all shapes. should be the primary method to position shapes in graphs -->

            <!-- the same problem occurs, the circle gets get off -->
            <!-- use same solution as with the rectangle, change the coordinates -->
            <!-- the attributes for setting a circles coordinates have different names than the rectangle -->
